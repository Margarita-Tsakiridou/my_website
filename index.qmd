# Welcome to my website!

My name is Margarita, I am from Greece, and I have been living in the UK since 2015. 

I hold a PhD from the School of the Environment, Geography and Geosciences, University of Portsmouth. My PhD thesis was titled 'Refining our understanding of Wildfire during the Last Glacial-Interglacial Transition". It investigated wildfire expression during the very abrupt climatic changes that occurred approximately 16,000-8,000 years Before Present. It showed, for the first time, that wildfire might have been a component of the landscape, likely driven at least in part, by climate.

Following my academic endeavours, I decided to use all that self-taught coding from my PhD and love for learning to become a data scientist! Learning new technologies has become one of my favourite things! Anything around programming and databases, I am probably learning about it, if not already using it in my job!

Outside of work I enjoy watching Netflix (who doesn't?), listening to podcasts, knitting and going to the gym (in that order). I also love cats and I hope to adopt one soon.
