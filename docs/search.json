    "text": "arXiv Preprint | Code\nOver the centuries, I have devoted countless hours to deciphering and translating the ancient scripts and dialects of the various peoples of Middle-earth. My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

My PhD thesis was titled ’Refining our understanding of Wildfire during the Last Glacial-Interglacial Transition”. It investigated wildfire expression during the very abrupt climatic changes that occurred approximately 16,000-8,000 years Before Present. It showed, for the first time, that wildfire might have been a component of the landscape, likely driven, at least in part, by climate.\nMy PhD was an amazing experience and I very much enjoyed being part of academia, teaching, and travelling all over the world for fieldwork and conferences. However, post-PhD academia can be a very stressful place with zero life-balance. This is what led me to the industry.\nI am currently at my second job post academia. Learning new technologies has become one of my favourite things! (Although I’d lie if I didn’t admit that I miss research a little bit.) I started my career as a data analyst and aspire to become a data scientist. Anything around programming and databases, I am probably already learning about it, if not already using it in my job!\nOutside of work I enjoy watching Netflix (who doesn’t?), listening to podcasts, knitting and going to the gym (in that order). I also love cats and I hope to adopt one soon."
