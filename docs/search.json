My PhD thesis was titled ’Refining our understanding of Wildfire during the Last Glacial-Interglacial Transition”. It investigated wildfire expression during the very abrupt climatic changes that occurred approximately 16,000-8,000 years Before Present. It showed, for the first time, that wildfire might have been a component of the landscape, likely driven, at least in part, by climate.\nMy PhD was an amazing experience and I very much enjoyed being part of academia, teaching, and travelling all over the world for fieldwork and conferences. However, post-PhD academia can be a very stressful place with zero life-balance. This is what led me to the industry.\nI am currently at my second job post academia. Learning new technologies has become one of my favourite things! (Although I’d lie if I didn’t admit that I miss research a little bit.) I started my career as a data analyst and aspire to become a data scientist. Anything around programming and databases, I am probably learning about it, if not already using it in my job!\nOutside of work I enjoy watching Netflix (who doesn’t?), listening to podcasts, knitting and going to the gym (in that order). I also love cats and I hope to adopt one soon."

Certifications are often listed as desirable or even essential criteria in job ads. Having worked extensively with Power BI, I wanted to improve my knowledge and add this credential to my CV. I started my preparation in Oct 2023. Microsoft Learn is a great starting point, but there are also videos, articles, as well as blogs of people who went through the process and are sharing their own hints and tips. Although in the beginning it felt like a daunting experience, I am very pleased that I have now successfully gone through it. I obtained my certification in Jan 2024. Looking back, it now feels like a pleasant experience. I am considering having a go at some more certifications. Maybe 2024 should for me be: New Year, new certifications."

I am now building a website for me!” I shared with my colleagues. I was expecting them to be impressed, which I think they were, but then, a brave one asked: “What do you, actually not you in particular, I mean anyone, might need a website for?”. Yes, I had a no clue. Although that did not go well (at all!), I built the website, and here it is: ta-daa! This is my way of wrapping up the year, even though I am still not sure what I will do with it. I always wanted to have one and now I do. I’ve built it based on resources I found online, and I am happy to help if you contact me. Happy Holidays everyone!"
