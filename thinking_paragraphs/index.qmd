I am very pleased to say that I passed the [Microsoft PL-300 exam](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exams/pl-300/), which means I now hold the [Microsoft Certified: Power BI Data Analyst Associate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/power-bi-data-analyst-associate/) certification. Certifications are often listed as desirable or even essential criteria in job ads. Having worked extensively with Power BI, I wanted to improve my knowledge and add this credential to my CV. I started my preparation in Oct 2023. [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exams/pl-300/) is a great starting point, but there are also videos, articles, as well as blogs of people who went through the process and are sharing their own hints and tips. Although in the beginning it felt like a daunting experience, I am very pleased that I have now successfully gone through it. I obtained my certification in Jan 2024. Looking back, it now feels like a pleasant experience. I am considering having a go at some more certifications. Maybe 2024 should for me be: New Year, new certifications.

## 21/12/2023: Wrapping up the year with a website

"I loved working with Quarto for our project and I discovered you can actually build websites with it. I am now building a website for me!" I shared with my colleagues. I was expecting them to be impressed, which I think they were, but then, a brave one asked: "What do you, actually not you in particular, I mean anyone, might need a website for?". Yes, I had a no clue. Although that did not go well (at all!), I built the website, and here it is: ta-daa! This is my way of wrapping up the year, even though I am still not sure what I will do with it. I always wanted to have one and now I do. I've built it based on [resources](https://www.marvinschmitt.com/blog/website-tutorial-quarto/) I found online, and I am happy to help if you contact me. Happy Holidays everyone!
